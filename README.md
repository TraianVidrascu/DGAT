# Bidirectional Neighborhood Model

The Bidirectional Neighborhood Model is an adaptation of the KBAT model from the paper: [Learning Attention-based Embeddings for Relation Prediction in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01195)

This implementation is standalone, but parts of the code are taken from the [KBAT pipeline](https://github.com/deepakn97/relationPrediction).
